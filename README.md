# Loan Prediction (Ensemble-models-using-Caret)
Ensemble technique is used for combining two or more algorithms of similar or dissimilar types.I
have performed One hot-encoding before splitting data and then recursive feature selection.
Different methods are used for predicting loan approval such as averaging, majority votes and
weighted average. I have applied Caret ensemble method which combines several models via
stacking. Applied robust classification algorithm such as Gradient boosting machine which the
accuracy of our model.
