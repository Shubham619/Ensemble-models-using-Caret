# Ensemble-models-using-Caret 
This technique of combining two or more algorithms of similar or dissimilar types.
Averaging,majority votes and weighted average are method of it.I also performed caret ensemble stacking which has multiple layers of machine learning models that are placed one over another where each of the models passes their predictions to the model in the layer above it and the top layer model takes decisions based on the below layers.I used Recursive Feature(rfe) elimination which is a wrapper method to find the best subset of features to use for modeling.Three different algorith are generalized linear model,random forest and gradient boosting machine using caret package.
